# Iris Flowers
As someone into horticulture, I followed my nose into utilizing a pretty common Iris dataset available on kaggle to create a super basic Neural Network model using primarily
torch.nn and torch.functional libraries
- In my code, you'll see step by step how I obtained data, trained my model, tested my model, and used it against my own data
This code is available in the 'iris.py' file
- The model currently holds a 97% success rate, but still super eager to learn how I can improve this metric!
